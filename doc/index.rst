Welcome to the documentation of oac-tree GUI
============================================

This is a user manual of the Graphical User Interface 
of ITER Sequencer, also known as `oac-tree`. The `oac-tree` is a C++ framework for creating 
and executing automation procedures based on the behavioral trees.
It is developed in the context of the ITER Supervision and Automation System (SUP).

The Graphical User Interface is intended to simplify various aspects of work with `oac-tree`, including browsing,
editing, execution, and debugging of automation procedures.

*Disclaimer*

The oac-tree GUI is under heavy development. All major components are already in place, however,
they require further adjustments to match actual user needs and workflow. The only thing we need
is your feedback. We very much welcome your suggestions for improvements and bug reports.
